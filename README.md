# devSrc

devSrc is a user curated library to share, store, and study software engineering resources within the student developer community.

## Why devSrc?

As SEI students, and as curious learners in general, we find and share a LOT of bookmarks for websites that have pertinent information. But those bookmarks can get lost in the shuffle. 
What was that site about again? Did I really find it useful or did I just slap it in my bookmarks without checking? I remember someone shared a resource on Slack last week that I liked, but I can't find it again! Such a pain!
devSrc provides a single place to search for user curated resources, store the ones you find useful, and share valuable resources with other users.
Added functionality brings in our studyBuddy component to cut down on learning costs (no more buying the bulk pack of index cards at Office Depot!) and our liveChat where users can share links on the fly and ask eachother questions.
